<p class="raj"><b> bengal is all about food and happyness.Bengal is known as the land of 'Maach aar Bhaat’ which means
    ‘fish and rice'.West Bengal is not just about machh bhaat and the sweets. It has a lot more to it and is a haven for both vegetarian
     and non-vegetarian foodies. so here is top 8 bengali dishes for you. </b> </p>
<ul>
    <li><h1>alu posto</h1></li>
    <p>alu posto is a classic Bengali dish. Sparing in its use of spices, this preparation relies on the flavours of potatoes, green chillies and nigella seeds for its taste. What stands out, however, is the nutty flavour of the roasted poppy paste, which also provides body and texture to the gravy. This apparently bland looking dish with just potato and posto is capable of rousing much passion among Bengalis.

        Although alu posto is cooked without onion or garlic, in our family we sometimes add a little fried onion to the alu posto for a pleasant variation.</p>
