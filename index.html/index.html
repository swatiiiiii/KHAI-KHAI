    <li><h1>Alu posto</h1></li>
    <p>Alu posto is a classic Bengali dish. Sparing in its use of spices, this preparation relies on the flavours of potatoes, green chillies and nigella seeds for its taste. What stands out, however, is the nutty flavour of the roasted poppy paste, which also provides body and texture to the gravy. This apparently bland looking dish with just potato and posto is capable of rousing much passion among Bengalis.

        Although alu posto is cooked without onion or garlic, in our family we sometimes add a little fried onion to the alu posto for a pleasant variation.</p>
